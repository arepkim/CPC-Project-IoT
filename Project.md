You are required to develop a practical IoT system addressing real-world urban challenges 
while contributing to UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 – Smart Cities. This project 
integrates theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation, culminating in a working 
prototype, visualization application, and comprehensive documentation. 

Project Objectives 
1. Design and implement a functional IoT system for smart city applications 
2. Demonstrate practical understanding of IoT architecture 
3. Apply cloud computing and data analytics concepts 
4. Visualize sensor data through web or mobile applications 

Technical Requirements 
Hardware 
You may use any suitable hardware platform including: 
• Raspberry Pi 
• Maker Feather S3 
• Any appropriate microcontroller with sensors 
Justify your choice of sensors based on your smart city application 

Cloud Platform 
You may choose any cloud platform including: 
• AWS (Amazon Web Services) 
• GCP (Google Cloud Platform) 
• Other suitable cloud platforms

Data Visualization 
Develop a web or mobile application to visualize sensor data. The visualization must clearly 
demonstrate real-time or historical data from your IoT system 
The core requirement is successful integration between your chosen hardware and cloud 
platform, demonstrating a complete IoT system with data collection, processing, and 
visualization capabilities. 

Deliverables 
You must submit a comprehensive technical report containing the following: 

1. System architecture 
• Detailed architecture diagram of your IoT system 
• Component descriptions and their interactions 
2. Hardware Documentation 
• List of sensors and hardware components used 
• Justification for sensor selection based on your smart city application 
• Hardware setup and configuration guide 
3. SDG 11 Impact Analysis 
• How your system addresses smart city challenges 
• Potential real-world impact 
4. GitHub/GitLab Repository Link 
• Link to your source code repository 
• Your repository must include: 
o All source code files 
o Comprehensive README file with project description 
o Setup and installation instructions 
o List of dependencies and requirements 
5. YouTube Video Link 
• Link to your demonstration video (public or unlisted) 
• The video must demonstrate: 
o System overview and architecture 
o Live demonstration of the working prototype 
o Data visualization (web/mobile application) 

Submission Instructions 
• This is a group submission – submit ONE technical report per group 
• Upload the technical report to eLEARN@USM 
• Marks will be deducted if: 
o Repository link and/or YouTube video link are not included in the report 
o Links are broken, incorrect, or inaccessible 
• Verify that your links are correct and accessible before submission 
• Email submissions of links will NOT be accepted – all links must be included in the PDF 
report 
⚠ IMPORTANT: Your IoT system implementation must be your own original work. 
• Do not copy existing projects from the internet. 
• Do not duplicate another student's work. 
• While you can use online resources for learning, your implementation must be unique. 
• Any form of plagiarism will result in serious academic consequences. 
Assignment Due Date: 11 January 2026, 11pm (MY time) 
All projects MUST be submitted before/on the given date. Late submissions will NOT be 
entertained.  
Plagiarism/pirating and copying are serious academic offence. Students that are found to 
plagiarize/or copying will get an F for the assignment/report or for the whole coursework 
grade.
